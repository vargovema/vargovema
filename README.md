### Hi there, I am Ema ðŸ‘‹

Data Science, business analytics, automation, and business development that fosters innovation have been my focus for the last couple of years. In the past, I was allowed to develop these skills further thanks to studying in a rigorous academic environment and immersing myself in automation and analytics. Currently, I would like to put my Machine Learning skills to practice and advance my career as an entry-level Data Scientist who is aspiring to master the implementation of Artificial Intelligence.

If you have and intersting projects I could possibly help with, feel free to reach out!
