### Hi there, I am Ema ðŸ‘‹

Analytics, Data Science, automation, and business development that fosters innovation are my passion. In the past few years, I was allowed to develop these skills further thanks to studying in a rigorous academic environment and immersing myself in automation and analytics. Currently, I am aiming to expand my IT skills as a part of my way to becoming a Data Scientist.

If you have and intersting projects I could possibly help with, feel free to reach out!
